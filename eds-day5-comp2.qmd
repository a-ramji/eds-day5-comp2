## Last Quarto Document & Project in EDS212 !!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Boolean

Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)

    -   = (this is this value --- not logical operator!)

-   != (do these NOT match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   &, \| , (and, or)

```{r}
# does 4 match 5

4 == 5
```

```{r}
# does 4 match 4
4 == 4

```

```{r}
# does 4 NOT match 5
4 != 5
```

```{r}
# does 4 match "4"
# (loose equality operator, in js 4 === "4" is false, == is true)
4 == "4"
```

```{r}
# with assigned variables

cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog
```

```{r}
# is cat greater than or equal to dog?
cat >= dog
```

```{r}
# Is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20?

dog > cat | cat < 20
```

```{r}
# is dog less than cat AND cat == 10

dog < cat & cat == 10
```

follows PEMDAS, still can (and maybe should) use parentheses :)

```{r}
dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4 >= dog
```
